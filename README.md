This app is a bare bones feelings tracking app, designed to help the user track their daily ups and downs with frequent check-ins, using feelings words from the categorized [list of feelings](https://www.cnvc.org/sites/default/files/feelings_inventory_0.pdf) from the Center for Non-Violent Communication. Using the inherent categorization and values indicating the intensity of the feeling, the user's dashboard displays graphs and charts displaying the progression of feelings, frequency of checkins, and strength of feeling over time, including a recap of the most recent checkins with their details.

This repo is the React Native front end for my Ada Developer's Academy final capstone project. To see the Ruby on Rails backend for the project see [this repo](https://github.com/bennettrahn/nvc-feelings-words).
